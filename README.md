# Rentbusters

This is a Chrome extension that provides information about potentially bustable rentals in the Netherlands (see https://reddit.com/r/rentbusters).

All data is provided u/i_look_good_in_black, I'm just putting it in a Chrome extension.

For now, this is a proof-of-concept, supporting only funda.nl and requiring manual data uploads on my part. If there's enough interest, I'll make it more user-friendly.
